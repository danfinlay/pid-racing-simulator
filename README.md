### [Live example here](http://requirebin.com/?gist=d1ca0f0eaeaf264e6b9b94be12d8013e)

```
 * Welcome to the world's most realistic auto-driving sim.
 *
 * In this game, you are a programmer for a self driving car
 * that will be driving critically bleeding patients to the hospital.
 * The further off the line you are, the harsher the terrain,
 * and the faster your patient bleeds out.
 *
 * Try to get to the finish line with as much blood in your patient
 * as possible!
