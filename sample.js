/*
 * PID AUTO DRIVING SIMULATOR!!!!
 *
 * Welcome to the world's most realistic auto-driving sim.
 *
 * In this game, you are a programmer for a self driving car
 * that will be driving critically bleeding patients to the hospital.
 * The further off the line you are, the harsher the terrain,
 * and the faster your patient bleeds out.
 *
 * Try to get to the finish line with as much blood in your patient
 * as possible!
 */

// Here is how you tell the car how to turn!
// The car has an x and y attribute you can check,
// as well as a rotation property.
// You want to be as close to the roadY as you can!
//
// Return a number of degrees to turn (added to your current turn)
// The car has a limit of how hard it can turn!
//
// Here's a very dumb driving function to get started:
var DrivingSim = require('./')
function decideTurnAngle(car) {

  var p = (opts.roadY - car.y) / 2
  var d = (car.rotation * -1) / 30

  return p + d
}

// Parameters: Tune your difficulty here!
var opts = {
  totalBlood: 9.48, // pints of blood in a 150lb human
  height: 600,      // play area height (px)
  width: 800,       // distance to hospital (px)
  startingOffset: 30, // How far from the road you start
  carSpeed: 2,        // How many pixels you move per frame
  roadY: 300,
  hardestTurn: 45,
  bloodLossPerFrame: 0.015,
  bloodLossPerPixelAwayPerFrame: 0.002,
}
